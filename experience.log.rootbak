[RUST/CARGO] ark-bn254 and ark-ec dependency version conflicts
Context: Building Anchor IDL with `anchor idl build`
Error: can't find crate for `ark_ec`, `ark_ff`; version conflicts between ark-bn254 0.4.0 and ark-ec 0.5.0
Solution: 1) Add `anchor-spl/idl-build` to idl-build feature in Cargo.toml; 2) Run `cargo clean` and remove Cargo.lock; 3) Rebuild dependencies

[BUILD] Permission denied when running anchor build
Context: Running `anchor build` command
Error: Permission denied (os error 13) - target directory and files owned by root (including target/release/.cargo-lock)

Files: target/, target/release/.cargo-lock

[SOLANA] Unable to read keypair file
Context: Running `anchor test` command
Error: Unable to read keypair file (/home/raywork/.config/solana/id.json) - file does not exist
Solution: 1) Generate wallet: `solana-keygen new --outfile /home/raywork/.config/solana/id.json --no-bip39-passphrase --force`; 2) Fix ownership: `sudo chown raywork:raywork /home/raywork/.config/solana/id.json`; 3) Configure Solana CLI: `solana config set --keypair /home/raywork/.config/solana/id.json --url localhost`

Context: Running `anchor test` command after previous sudo operations
Error: failed to open: /home/raywork/orderly/solana-learning/solana-amm/target/release/.cargo-lock - Permission denied (os error 13)
Solution: Run `sudo chown -R raywork:raywork target/` to recursively fix ownership of entire target directory. This happens when previous commands were run with sudo (e.g., cargo clean, solana-keygen with sudo)

[TEST] Permission denied when running anchor test
Context: Running `anchor test` command, test suite execution fails with Permission denied
Error: Permission denied (os error 13) - .anchor/test-ledger and .anchor/program-logs directories owned by root
Solution: Run `sudo chown -R raywork:raywork .anchor/ target/` to fix ownership of all test-related directories. Ensure all operations run under raywork user as specified in .cursorrules
Files: .anchor/test-ledger/, .anchor/program-logs/, target/
